TITLE:
Create .gitignore to exclude generated files and secrets

BODY:
## Context

This is part of **Tier 1: Foundation & Continuous Integration**, which establishes the Node.js project skeleton, installs core dependencies, configures the test runner, and wires a CI pipeline before any business logic is introduced.

A `.gitignore` file must be placed at the project root to prevent generated files, dependency directories, coverage output, local environment secrets, and database files from being committed to the repository. Without this file, developers risk accidentally pushing `node_modules/`, coverage reports, `.env` secrets, or local SQLite databases into version control — bloating the repo, leaking credentials, and causing merge conflicts.

The entries align with the project structure defined in the tier document and are standard practice for any Node.js project.

## Implementation Notes

Create a `.gitignore` file at the project root with the following contents:

```
node_modules/
coverage/
.env
*.db
```

### Entry Rationale

| Entry | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `node_modules/` | Dependency directory installed via `npm install`; reproducible from `package-lock.json` via `npm ci` |
| `coverage/` | Jest coverage output generated by `npm test` (configured in `jest.config.js` with `coverageDirectory: 'coverage'`) |
| `.env` | Local environment variables containing secrets (e.g., `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`); developers create this from `.env.example` |
| `*.db` | SQLite or other local database files that may be generated during development or testing |

### Notes

- This task has **no dependencies** on other tasks and can be completed at any time.
- The `.env.example` template file (which documents required environment variables) should **not** be ignored — only `.env` itself is excluded.
- Future tiers may require additional ignore entries; they should be appended to this file as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.gitignore` file exists at the project root
- [ ] `node_modules/` is listed as an ignored pattern
- [ ] `coverage/` is listed as an ignored pattern
- [ ] `.env` is listed as an ignored pattern
- [ ] `*.db` is listed as an ignored pattern
- [ ] `.env.example` is **not** ignored (verified by `git status` showing it as trackable)
- [ ] Running `git status` after `npm install` does not show `node_modules/` as untracked

## Dependencies

None — this task has no prerequisites and can be completed independently.
